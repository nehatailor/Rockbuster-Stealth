Here is another SQL query with a common table expression

WITH top_five-customers_country_cte AS
(SELECT E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city,
        SUM (amount) AS Total_Amount_Paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey','Indonesia')
AND C.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
ORDER BY SUM(amount) desc
LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country
COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS "all_customer_count",
COUNT(DISTINCT top_five_customers_country_ctea.customer_id) AS top_five_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id = top_five_customers_country_cte.country
GROUP BY D.country
