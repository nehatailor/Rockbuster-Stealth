Here the SQL query looks at how many of the top five customers are based within each country. 
The final output of the query includes: country, the total number of customers in each country and how many of the top 5 customers live in each country.

SELECT D.country, COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS "all_customer_count",
COUNT (DISTINCT x.customer_id) AS top_five_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city,
        SUM(amount) AS Total_amount_Paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id

ORDER BY SUM(amount) desc
LIMIT 5) AS x ON D.country = x.country
